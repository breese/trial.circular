= <<span.adoc#,Circular Span>>

The circular span is a view that makes user-owned contiguous storage appear
like a circular queue.

= <<array.adoc#,Circular Array>>

The fixed-sized circular array is a circular queue operating on an embedded
`std::array<T, N>`. Unlike `std::array<T, N>` this class also keeps track of how
many elements have been inserted.
