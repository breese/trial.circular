= Circular Span

== Introduction

The `circular::span<T>` template class is a span that turns continguous memory
into a double-ended circular queue.

[cols="20,80",frame="none",grid="none",stripes=none]
|===
| Span | The storage is not owned by the span. The owner of the memory is
   responsible for destroying the span before releasing the memory.
| Circular | Inserting elements into the span will remove elements at the
   other end of the span when the span is full. If elements always are inserted
   at the same end, then we effectively have a moving window over the most
   recent elements.
| Double-ended | Elements can be inserted either at the beginning or the end
   of the span. This enables fixed-sized first-in-first-out or last-in-first-out
   usages.
| Queue | Elements can only be inserted and erased at the beginning or end of
   the span.

[#span-tutorial]
== Tutorial

Suppose we receive a sequence of numerical values one by one over time, and we
want to calculate the running average of the `N` most recent values. Our class
should at least support the following interface for inserting new values and
for returning the current mean.
[source,c++,numbered]
----
template <typename T, std::size_t N>
class waverage
{
public:
    using value_type = T; 

    waverage() noexcept;

    // Insert new value
    void push(value_type value) noexcept;
    // Return current mean
    value_type mean() const noexcept;
};
----
When we insert a new value, the oldest value must be removed from our running
average, so we have to remember the `N` most recent values.
We therefore want to reserve storage for `N` values, and have an efficient way
of inserting new values and removing old values from this storage.
We are going to use a circular span (`circular::span<value_type, N> window`)
that uses an array (`value_type storage[N]`) as storage.
[source,c++,numbered]
----
template <typename T, std::size_t N>
class waverage
{
public:
    using value_type = T; 

    waverage() noexcept;

    void push(value_type input) noexcept;
    value_type mean() const noexcept;

private:
    static_assert(N > 0, "N must be greater than zero");
    value_type sum = {};
    value_type storage[N];
    circular::span<value_type, N> window;
};
----
We start by initializing the circular span to use the array as storage.
[source,c++,numbered]
----
template <typename T, std::size_t N>
waverage::waverage()
    : window(storage) // Instruct span to use storage
{
}
----
Notice that the array is automatically filled with default-constructed elements.
These will be overwritten one by one when inserting new values into the window.

When new values are inserted we first update the running sum. This is done by
undoing the effect of the oldest value (`window.front()`) if the window is
full. There is a pre-condition for `span<T, N>::front()` that it can only be
called if the window is not empty; this is guaranteed by the call to `window.full()`.

Afterwards we store the input value in the window (`window.push_back(input)`)
such that we can undo its effect when it later leaves the window. As the
`push_back()` function overwrites the oldest value at the front, it is important
that we update the running sum before we store the input value.
[source,c++,numbered]
----
template <typename T, std::size_t N>
void waverage::push(value_type input) noexcept
{
    // Update the current mean
    if (window.full())
    {
        sum += input - window.front();
    }
    else
    {
        sum += input;
    }
    // Remember the input value for later use
    window.push_back(input);
}
----
The current mean is the calculated as the running sum divided by the number of
elements in the window.
[source,c++,numbered]
----
template <typename T, std::size_t N>
T waverage::mean() const noexcept
{
    assert(!window.empty());

    return sum / window.size();
}
----

== Design Rationale

This section describes the choices behind the design of the circular span.

[#rationale-extent]
=== Extent

The extent is an optional template argument that specifies the capacity of the
span at compile-time. The capacity is part of the span type and therefore does
not have to be stored as a member variable.

If the `Extent` template argument is omitted, or specified as `dynamic_extent`,
the capacity is determined when the span is constructed. The capacity does not
change after construction, unless the span is recreated by assignment. For this
case, the capacity is stored as a member variable.

The extent has been introduced for alignment with `std::span<T, Extent>`.

[#rationale-no-mutable-iterator]
=== No Mutable Iterators

Although `circular::span<T>` has been designed to work well with standard algorithms,
it has no mutable iterators. Some mutating algorithms may modify the storage of the
destination container in a way that causes the destination span to become invalid.

For instance `std::copy` copies the elements from one container into another
container by accessing the elements directly in storage, which means that the
container is not informed about those changes. Consequently, the internal state
of the input span is not copied to the destination span.

Therefore there is a `circular::span<T>::const_iterator` but no
`circular::span<T>::iterator`.

Using `std::copy` with `std::front_inserter` or `std::back_inserter` does work as
expected though.

Mutable `operator[]` also exists if there is a need to update existing elements.
This operator cannot insert new elements, so the above-mentioned problem for
mutable iterators does not exists for mutable `operator[]`.

[#rationale-subspans]
=== Subspans

Circular span supports subspans, but unlike `std::span` a subspans of a circular
span is not another circular span. Creating a circular span must be done on
contiguous storage. Although circular span operates on contiguous storage, the
range from `begin()` until `end()` is not guaranteed to be contiguous as it may
wrap around the underlying storage. In other words, a circular span cannot be
constructed from another circular span.

Instead `span<T>::const_segment` is used to represent subspans. The type fulfills
the _BidirectionalRange_ requirements, which means that it has `begin()` and
`end()` functions returning a _BidirectionalIterator_. Beyond that, the type is
unspecified.

There are two member functions that returns a subspan: `front_segment()` returns
a range of all contiguous elements starting from the front of the span, and
`back_segment` returns a range of any left-over elements that have been wrapped
around in the underlying storage.
This functionality is useful for use cases such as zero-copy network transmission
of the circular span.

While `front_segment()` and `back_segment()` returns segments of contiguous storage
and therefore could have returned a circular span, this is not necessarily the
case for other kinds of subspans we may want to add. However, as the circular span
itself fulfills the _BidirectionalRange_ we could choose to implement `const_segment`
in terms of circular span, although a more lean span type, like `std::span` would
be a more prudent choice.

== Reference

Defined in header `<trial/circular/span.hpp>`.

Defined in namespace `trial::circular`.
[source,c++]
----
template <
    typename T,
    std::size_t Extent = dynamic_extent
> class span;
----
The span template class is a circular view of some external contiguous memory.

The extent determines the capacity of the span, that is the maximum number of
elements that the span can contain.
If `dynamic_extent` is used then the capacity is derived from the input arguments
at construction or assignment time. Otherwise the capacity is fixed to the
specified `Extent` template argument. Dynamic extent is used by default.
